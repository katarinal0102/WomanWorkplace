Women's Safety in Companies - Platform for Anonymous Reviews
About the project
This project was created as a result of my participation in a women's hackathon organized by the Merkle company, and was realized during my third year of study. The topic of the project was the safety of women in companies, with the aim of improving the safety and well-being of women in the workplace.

The project was developed in Java, and the goal is to enable women to anonymously share their experiences about working conditions, safety, and culture in the companies where they work. The platform provides a space for exchanging opinions and evaluating work environments, thus creating a safe environment for women who want to talk about their experiences, without fear of negative consequences.

Future plans
Introducing additional security functionalities such as data encryption and better protection of user privacy.
